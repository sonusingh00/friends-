    <h1>Who is Karan?</h1>
    <h2>
        We might have first met in B.B.S swimming club, and then I learned he is a friend of Ankit too.
    </h2>
    <h3>
        A very entertaining boy with a silent killer mind. He starts working when it's really needed.
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Karan, your passion for coding shines brightly, and the fact that you're honing your skills on a phone proves how determined and resourceful you are. That kind of commitment separates dreamers from doers. Keep pushing forward with that fire, because nothing can stop you from achieving greatness. Passion is your fuel, and it's inspiring to see you bring it to life.
